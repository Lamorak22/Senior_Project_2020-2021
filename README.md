# Senior_Project_2020-2021
This repository will contain any code used in my automated garden senior project.

The project has a lot more moving parts to it and things have changed so the files in this repository may not be up to date or relevant.

Gardening is a hobby that many people would like to participate in, but few people do it. Why? Two main factors are a lack of both time and money. The solution for this is an automated garden. Though there are other automated garden projects out there, many do not cater to beginners. The goal of this project is to allow a beginner to start a garden and then have the garden maintain itself so that the gardener does not have to pour all their time into it. This project will also be unique because it will include a “plant recommendation program.” This program will recommend the user what to plant based on their location, a tentative planting date, and historical weather data.
